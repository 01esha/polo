Caching for FileItem objects
-------------------------------
All FileItem objects that are directories are cached. This allows the path to be resolved to a FileItem object when user types a path in the pathbar. Children will be queried everytime by calling query_children(). Existing child objects will be reused instead of creating new child objects.

There is no use of caching FileItem objects that are files. query_file_info() is the only method that takes time while creating a new object, and it needs to be queried everytime to determine if the file is stale.

There is a significant delay in loading thumbnail files from disk. Icons and thumbnails for FileItem objects are cached in memory (using class IconCache) to improve performance. Following parameters are used as key: path, changed timestamp, icon size, load_thumbnail, use_transparency, use_emblems.

Archives
------------------------
* In TEST mode, the archive is extracted to a temporary directory. 7zip has a switch (-so) for writing output to stdout. This can be used to send the extracted data to /dev/null. However, in this case 7zip does not report any progress. So this is currently not used.

7z x '/home/teejee/aam/samples/atom.7z' -so '-w/tmp/polo/0t9VJHWD/14616630804292682152/rrsv6Nh3' -y -bb1 -p -- > /dev/null

* 7zip cannot handle LZOP files (both single or tarred). TAR can list TAR.LZO files. LZO files can be listed only with 'lzop -l'. LZO can store multiple files but cannot store paths (directories).
